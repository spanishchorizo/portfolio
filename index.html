            <p>This is the week 01 assignment. We had to summarize what HTML5 semantic elements are and their purpose. Then, we had to code a html document using 15 semantic elements correctly from the week's readings.</p>

          <h3>Lesson 02: <a href="file:///Users/gracecellinibugay/Desktop/Html110/portfolio/index.html">Portfolio</a></h3>

            <p>This week's assignment is to create a two-page portfolio site. Our previous work from week 01 is listed and linked. Included with each lesson's assignment is a small image related to the assignment, as well as a short blurb about what it is about.</p>
